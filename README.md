# Laptops_Data_Cleaning_Fundamentals_with_Pandas
In these project based exercises fundamental Data Cleaning operations are applied in Pandas to clean laptops data.

Fundamental data cleaning operations used to clean the data:

•	Loading csv files with encodings
•	Using a definition and for-loop to clean column names from characters and change it to snake case.
•	Extracting string 0 as new names.
•	Replacing / (stripping columns from substrings) substrings in column entries with ‘nothing’ and returning the entries as numerical values.
•	Using a mapping dictionary to correct bad values.
•	Dropping or filling missing values.
•	Cleaning a string column.
•	Saving the cleaned data to a different name in csv format.

These Pandas exercises was done through DataQuest and they also provided the dataset laptops.csv. Originally these exercises were done using pure Python, but I converted the code to run in this Jupyter Notebook. The original Python code is also available in the same file as this notebook.
